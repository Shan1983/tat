# Team Allocation Tool (TAT)

The Team Allocation Tool (TAT) is a web-based system that will take a group of people and using multiple metrics divide them into balanced teams for a given set of projects.

The main objectives of the project are:
- To deliver an algorithm that creates balanced teams
- To provide supporting interfaces that facilitate the use of this algorithm
- To deliver the results of the algorithm from valid inputs.

Importantly, this project will develop a prototype solution only.  The solution will be deliberately constrained to work only within a University environment.

## Background

In an academic environment there is often the need to form balanced teams for projects in a course. This is currently done manually by students self allocating themselves to a team or project.

The problem with this approach is that it can be time consuming, with significant effort required to coordinate.  In particular, the teams formed by students are often not  balanced in terms of skills, levels, grades and other factors. 

The TAT attempts to solve this problem by automating the process of team formation with the key objective of delivering balanced teams to provide the most rewarding and appropriate learning outcome.

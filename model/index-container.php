			<div class="h1">How does it work?</div>
			<p>Once your course has been entered into the system, you login and create the projects to which the students will be assigned.  Along with setting the maximum and minimum group size for each project, you must establish the skills and their level required.</p>
			<p>Team Allocation Tool is a web-based system and can therefore be accessed from any internet-capable computer.  This provides your student body with the ability to input their skills from any location.  This is an undemanding task that has been demonstrated to take at most 5 minutes for even the most computer illiterate student.  And once all your students have completed this task the system will notify you via email.  Of course, you can login and monitor the current status of your course – with statistics on number of students yet to enter their details.</p>
			<p>With all data entry complete you then press the button.  That’s it.  The system does the rest.</p>
